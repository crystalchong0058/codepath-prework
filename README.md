## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Tiny bits of errors made the whole app crash and would not work out. I was stuck so many times while typing the functions and then realize I missed a character/symbol. Uploading the file to Github was also a challenge as it is my first time using this website, and moving the files to the correct location made my app went missing. It took me a lot of time and I had to redo the app several times.
